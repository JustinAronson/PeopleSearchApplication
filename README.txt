Running this project in Visual Studio will produce an application that implements the specifications given as part of the Health Catalyst software development exercise.  
This project is based on a pattern I learned from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio.
Much of the CSS styling is based on patterns taken from W3 Schools.
I was not able to implement the unit tests yet, though given more time I would be happy to do so.
Thank you for this opportunity, I have learned a lot about C# from it!
